## about the combination of the head .obj and hair .data

When you use Hair20k, be careful to choose a head model and hair; there are two head models. One is used at USC-HairSalon, and the other is the model called [AVATAR NEO]( https://www.avatarneo.com/PinscreenGenericHeadModel.obj ).
The main difference between the former and the latter is its scale. To simulate correctly, choose the correct hair .data following the instructions on the page.

Please note that the model used at the [Digital-Salon project](https://github.com/digital-salon/Digital-Salon) is AVATAR NEO. Thus, the hair models used there are the hair20k aligned with AVATAR NEO.
